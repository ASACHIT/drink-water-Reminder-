#100DaysOfPython
**day 5 - A simple Python reminder that prompts me to drink water every 30 minutes. I've also included it in the startup items so that it can run in the background with Windows.**
  # how to setup ? 
  **clone this repoand add run.vbs file in startup item from taskscheduler of window and done.. it will run automatically with window.**
